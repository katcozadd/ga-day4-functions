//Verbal Questions
//1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
//When initially writing a function, the parameter is the first set of () that you run into for example:
//const myFunction = (*this is the parameter*) => {
//	console.log(lalala);
//}
//The argument is the value that you put into the () when calling the function.

//2. Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
//console.log will only print out what is in the () in the console.
//Return statements will print out what the function evaluates to.
